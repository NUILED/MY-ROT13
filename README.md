ROT13 is a simple encryption technique that involves rotating the letters of the alphabet by 13 positions. Each letter is replaced by the letter 13 places ahead of it in the alphabet, wrapping around to the beginning of the alphabet if necessary. For example, the letter "A" is replaced by "N", "B" is replaced by "O", and so on.

ROT13 is a Caesar cipher with a fixed key, meaning that the encryption key (the number 13) is always the same. ROT13 is a very weak encryption method and is not considered secure for protecting sensitive information. It is mainly used for obscuring text from casual readers, such as hiding the answer to a puzzle or spoiler in plain sight.
